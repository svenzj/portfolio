// This component adds a delay, 1 millisecond by default, to the visibility of all child components.
//
// Motivation:
// The reason this control was created is to wrap a masonry component that initially renders all items vertically (causing a scrollbar), before rendering them in masonry "rows," causing unacceptable flicker.
// There is a commonly known problem of FOUC (flash of unstyled content) where you see an initial rendering of your content before your stylesheets are downloaded.
// There is a similar problem that can happen with Javascript where visible elements on the page are rendered in script and take a moment to fully render.
// This can result in a flicker, sometimes causing a scrollbar to appear and go away, which then causes the whole page's width to be reduced momentarily causing further re-layout activity.
// This DelayedChild componet offres a solution that is probably not ideal but can be useful in certain circumstances.
//
// Functionality:
// This component works by rendering its child components inside a box that is initially set to be invisible and to have a small fixed height and scrollbar 
// so even if the content is "tall" it will just scroll inside this small heigh box and not cause the main browser window to need a scrollbar.
// We do this so that the fixed height box itself will be very unlikely to cause any flicker (e.g. if its content was so tall that it caused a vertical scrollbar be required).
// It is important that we make the child components "invisible" with visibility rather than display: none so that they actually render on the page, allowing the Javascript to do its rendering work.
// Once the delay has finished, and in theory all code in the child components is complete, we remove the fixed height and vertical overflow / scroll behavior and set the box to be visible again.
// 
// Limitations:
// We don't know how long of a delay is required and in theory if we don't wait long enough for the script to complete its work, our approach won't work.
// However, we only set a 1 ms delay and have not had any issues.
// 
// Future Development:
// Perhaps make the delay a property of the component that the parent can set.
